                <h2>Reimag(in)e App</h2>
                <p>Reimag(in)e is a mobile application that allows you to upload photos and generate AI-powered images using OpenAI's technology. We want to be completely transparent about how your data is handled:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Image Storage:</strong> Photos you upload are not stored in our database. They are only used temporarily to generate AI images and are immediately discarded.</li>
                    <li><strong>Generated Images:</strong> AI-generated images are not stored in our database. All generated images are only saved locally on your device.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect or store any personal information from Reimag(in)e users in our database.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Processing:</strong> While we use OpenAI's API to generate images, no personal information is passed to OpenAI. Only the uploaded photo and generation prompts are sent for processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device-Only Storage:</strong> All images (both your original photos and generated images) remain exclusively on your device. You have full control over your data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Reimag(in)e is designed with privacy in mind - your photos stay on your device, and we don't track or store your image data.</p>
